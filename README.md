## Name
Mucic Player 

## Description
This is a music player application written in C#. It has some besic features such as skipping, pausing or stopping song. You can also search for a specific song or artist in the search bar. This feature can also serve as a sorting feature. 

## Installation
I have used two libraries in this project, NAudio, version 2.1.0 and Newtonsoft.Json, version 13.0.3. They both can be installed using NuGet package manager in Visual Studio. The application runs on WinForms. 

## Usage
This application is to be used with MP3 and WAV files. To use this application, the user should have some audio files on their device. They upload these files to the application with the browse button, then they are added to the Json file. If the user doesn't want to have some songs in the application they can remove it with the remove button. Then they can interact with files with help of multiple buttons such as play, stop, pause, next or previous. It's also possible to search song with the search bar or skip to the desired time stamp of the song or rename them.
